## What is it

A set of plugins/modules that can be used inside the NEO core library is available in this repository. You can refer to [the official documentation](https://docs.neo.org/docs/en-us/node/cli/setup.html) for the more detailed usage guide. 

In addition, a C# SDK module is included for developers to call RPC methods with ease.

## Using Plugins
Plugins can be used to increase functionality, as well as providing policies definitions of the network.
One common example is to add the ApplicationLogs plugin in order to enable your node to create log files.

To configure a plugin, you can directly download the desired plugin from the [Releases page](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-modules/releases).

Alternatively, you can compile from source code by following the below steps:
- Clone this repository;
- Open it in Visual Studio, select the plugin you want to enable and select `publish` \(compile it using Release configuration\)
- Create the Plugins folder in neo-cli / neo-gui (where the binary file is located, such as `/neo-cli/bin/Release/netcoreapp3.0/Plugins`)
- Copy the .dll and the folder with the configuration files into the `Plugins` folder.
  - Remarkably, you should put the dependency of the plugin in the `Plugins` folder as well. For example, since the `RpcServer` has the package reference on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.ResponseCompression`, so the corresponding dll file should be put together with the plugin.

The resulting folder structure is going to be like this:

```sh
./neo-cli.dll
./Plugins/ApplicationLogs.dll
./Plugins/ApplicationsLogs/config.json
```

## Plugins/Modules

### ApplicationLogs
Add this plugin to your application if need to access the log files. This can be useful to handle notifications, but remember that this also largely increases the space used by the application. `LevelDBStore` and `RpcServer` are also needed for this plugin. You can find more details [here](https://docs.neo.org/docs/en-us/reference/rpc/latest-version/api/getapplicationlog.html).

### SystemLog
Enable neo-cli Logging with timestamps by showing messages with different levels (shown with different colors) \(useful for debugging\).

### StatesDumper
Exports neo-cli status data \(useful for debugging\), such as storage modifications block by block.

### LevelDBStore
If there is no further modification of the configuration file of the neo-node, it is the default storage engine in the NEO system. In this case, you should paste the `LevelDBStore` in the Plugins before launching the node.

### RocksDBStore
You can also use `RocksDBStore` in the NEO system by modifying the default storage engine section in the configuration file.

### RpcServer
Plugin for hosting a RpcServer on the neo-node, being able to disable specific calls.

### RpcNep5Tracker
Plugin that enables NEP5 tracking using LevelDB.
This module works in conjunction with RpcServer, otherwise, just local storage (on leveldb) would be created. 

## C# SDK

### RpcClient
The RpcClient Project is an individual SDK that is used to interact with NEO blockchain through NEO RPC methods for development using. The main functions include RPC calling, Transaction making, Contract deployment & calling, and Asset transfering.
It needs a NEO node with the `RpcServer` plugin as a provider. And the provider needs more plugins like `RpcNep5Tracker` and `ApplicationLogs` if you want to call RPC methods supplied by the plugins.
